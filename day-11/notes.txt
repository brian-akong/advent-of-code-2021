- Create 10x10 grid
- Iterate 100 times
    - Add 1 to each element
        - If value if greater than 9, flash (keep track of flashes)
    - If adjacent element touches a flashing element, add an additional 1 to that element
        - Repeat until there are no more flahses for that iteration

- Increment all elements
- Check for values > 9
    - If true, set to 0, increment surrounding elements
        - Keep track of indices that are set to 0 and ensure they are all set to 0 throughout the iteration
- Check all elements again
    - Keep repeating until no more flashes occur

1.) Format input data
    - put first set of numbers into a list - numbers_list
    - Put the next 25 numbers into a 5 x 5 matrix i.e. 5, 5 element long lists - bingo_cards
        - [[5 elements], [5 elements], [5 elements], [5 elements], [5 elements]]

2.) Read each element out of numbers_list
3.) Iterate through bingo_cards
    - check if there is a winner
        - if winner found -> sum unmarked/uncalled numbers on card and multiply by last called number

* function to determine a winning card
    - check:
        row by row -> 1st - 5th elements contained called numbers?
        column by column -> 1st - 5th elements contained called numbers?
        
* mark numbers on each bingo card (to find numbers that aren't marked)

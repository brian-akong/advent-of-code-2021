- Count number of delimiter symbols in each line (4 kinds: parenthesis, square bracket, brace, chevron)
    - If number of specific delimiter symbol is not even, then that delimiter symbol is part of a corrupted chunk
        - Check to see which kind of delimiter it is
- Calculate score for that delimiter
    - Make dictionary for delimiter scores

- Iterate through characters
    - If current character is followed by a "closing" character -> is it the matching closing character?
        - if yes, remove both characters
        - if not, incorrect syntax
            - Calculate score and add to rolling total

Approach #3:
- Find all (), [], {}, <> pairs and remove
    while matching delimiters exist:
        - remove
- Check for all combinations?
